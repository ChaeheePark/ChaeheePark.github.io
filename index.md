I am a final-semester student of the M.Sc. in Applied Artificial Intelligence at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU), Seoul. Before this, I completed my B.S. degree in Human-Centered AI and Applied Artificial Intelligence at Sangmyung University, Seoul.

I am interested in applying artificial intelligence and computer vision to research aimed at social good, with a particular focus on scene understanding (object detection, MLLM). My interests also extend to exploring these technologies within clinical and psychological therapy domains.
