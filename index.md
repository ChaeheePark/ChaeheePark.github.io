I am a **final-semester student of the M.Sc. in Applied Artificial Intelligence at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU), Seoul**. Before this, I completed my B.S. degree in Human-Centered AI and Applied Artificial Intelligence at Sangmyung University, Seoul.

I am interested in **<U>applying artificial intelligence and computer vision to research aimed at social good</U>**, with a particular focus on scene understanding. My interests also extend to exploring these within clinical and psychological therapy domains with Multimodal LLMs.
